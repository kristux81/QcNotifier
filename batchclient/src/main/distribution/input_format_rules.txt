SYNTAX RULES FOR INI INPUT FILE
--------------------------------

1) File Format : Windows .ini format with similar named multiple sections supported.
                 Hierarchy :  Section
                                 |------ Parameter = Value
                  
                (A) Section
                 	- Section name could be any word with numbers included. 
                 	- It must be enclosed in []
                 	- The parameters provided in a section are order independent.
                 	
                (B) Parameters
                    - Names are fixed (as provided in sample_input.txt) however case-insensitive
                    - Use '=' only for assignment of values to parameters.
                    
                    - Mandatory Parameters : 
                        testSetPath,
					    testSetName,
					    testPath,
					    testInstance,
					    testStatus
					    
                   - Optional Parameters :
                        testVersion,
                        testMessage,
                        testBasePath
						                   
                   - Custom Parameters :
                        You can add a custom parameter to your project in QC 
                        and use the label of that parameter with this tdnotifier module 
                        to provide a input value

					Example : [TESTRUN]
								testSetPath   = /Root/testsetfolder/testsetfolder1
								testSetName   = testset
								testPath      = /Subject/testfolder/testfolder1
								testInstance  = [1]test
								testStatus    = Failed
                                            
                (C) Value 
                    - Do not use "" around values even if there is a 'space' between characters.
                      QC interprets "" in a special way.
                    - All multiple occurrences of '=' in any line would be added to value


2) Comments : #, // act as comment line if placed at the start of line since the parser is line buffered.
                         
			   Example : 
					# This is a comment line 
					//This is also a comment line

3) 	Paragraph as input for comments or description fields

				- In order to provide values spanning across multiple lines (paragraph) repeat the key.    
				  For instance if you want to write a detailed testMessage then it can be put as :
				  
				  [TESTRUN]
				    testSetPath   = /Root/testsetfolder/testsetfolder1
					testSetName   = testset
					testInstance  = [1]test
					testStatus    = Failed
					testMessage   = My message begins here
					testMessage   = and it is very interesting to read
					testMessage   =	and i can go on and on ...
